    The first computer was invented by Charles Babbage (1822) but was not built until 1991! Alan Turing invented computer science. The ENIAC (1945) was the first electronic general-purpose digital computer; it filled a room. The Micral N was the world's first “personal computer”(1973).

    The first computer company was Electronic Controls Company and was founded in 1949 by J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly, the same individuals who helped create the ENIAC computer. The company was later renamed to EMCC (Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation) and released several mainframe computers under the UNIVAC (Universal Automatic Computer) name.Computers work by combining input, storage, processing, and output 1. The main parts of a computer system are involved in one of these four processes. Input devices like the keyboard and mouse are used to get information into the computer that it can process. The data is then stored in the computer’s memory, which is used to hold data temporarily while the computer is running 1. The central processing unit (CPU) is responsible for processing the data stored in memory. It performs arithmetic and logical operations on the data to produce results 1. Finally, output devices like the monitor and printer are used to display or print the results of the processing

    When you press the power button on a computer, it sends a signal to the power supply, which converts alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC) and supplies the computer and its components with the proper amount of voltage and electricity 2. Once the computer has ample power, it sends a signal to the motherboard and CPU using transistors. While this is happening, the processor clears any leftover data in memory registers and gives the CPU program counter a F000 hexadecimal number. This number tells the CPU that it’s ready to process instructions at this location contained in the BIOS (basic input/output system).Windows 11 is the latest version of the Windows operating system. It comes with a redesigned interface, new productivity and social features, and updates to security and accessibility 12. Here are some of the new features in Windows 11:

    
The BIOS begins the POST (power-on self-test) when it first looks at itself. This sequence makes sure that all necessary components are present and functioning properly. If any errors are found during this test, an irregular POST is generated. If no errors are found, basic device drivers and interrupt handlers for hardware such as hard drives, keyboards, mice, and floppy drives are loaded. These basic drivers allow the CPU to communicate with these hardware devices and allow the computer to continue its boot process 2.
